I'm aÂ **machine learning engineer**Â interested in creating engaging human-AI interactions. With experience in medical imaging and computer vision, I'm currently exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs) in the field of healthcare and beyond.

Iâ€™m working as an AI Engineer at [3billion](https://3billion.io) (since December 2023). Previously, I worked as a front-end software engineer at [Dancers Connect](https://www.dancers-connect.com/). I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/).
