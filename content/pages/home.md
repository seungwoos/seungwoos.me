I'm aÂ **machine learning engineer** exploring the human-AI interaction, with a particular focus on generative models. Having built expertise in medical imaging and computer vision, I'm currently investigating on language and vision AI models for meaningful interactions between humans and machines.

Iâ€™m working as an AI Engineer at [3billion](https://3billion.io) (since December 2023). Previously, I worked as a front-end software engineer at [Dancers Connect](https://www.dancers-connect.com/), and hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/).
